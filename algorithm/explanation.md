### Algorithm Explanation and Thought Process

The function `section3(l, t)` solves the problem of finding all combinations of digits from 1 to 9 that:

1. Have a length of exactly `l`.
2. Sum up to exactly `t`.
3. Use each digit at most once.
4. Do not include duplicate combinations (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` is the same as `[3, 2, 1]`).

### Thought Process:

1. **Input Validation and Requirements**:

   - The function assumes valid inputs: `l` is the desired combination length, and `t` is the target sum.
   - Digits are fixed as `[1, 2, 3, ..., 9]`, meaning the search space is limited to these values.

2. **Algorithm Design**:

   - **Recursive Backtracking**:
     - Start with an empty combination and incrementally add digits.
     - Ensure that each digit is used at most once and only appears in ascending order to avoid duplicates.
   - **Stopping Conditions**:
     - Stop exploring if the current combination length exceeds `l` or the sum exceeds `t`.
     - Add a combination to the result list if it exactly matches the required length and sum.

3. **Helper Function**:

   - `findCombinations(startIndex, currentCombination, currentSum)`:
     - Tracks:
       - `startIndex`: Ensures that only unused digits are considered to avoid duplicate combinations.
       - `currentCombination`: The digits currently selected.
       - `currentSum`: The running total of the current combination.
     - Implements the backtracking logic:
       - Tries each digit starting from `startIndex`.
       - Adds the digit to the current combination and updates the sum.
       - Recursively continues exploring further digits.
       - Backtracks by removing the last digit to explore other possibilities.

4. **Efficiency**:

   - Backtracking eliminates invalid paths early (e.g., combinations that are too long or exceed the target sum).
   - The use of `startIndex` avoids duplicate combinations without requiring additional checks or sorting.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `l` is greater than 9, the result is always empty because there are only 9 digits.
   - If `t` is too small or too large to be achieved by any `l` digits, the result is empty.

### Step-by-Step Execution Example:

#### Input: `l = 3`, `t = 6`

1. Start with an empty combination (`currentCombination = []`) and sum (`currentSum = 0`).
2. Try adding each digit:
   - Add `1`, then recursively explore further:
     - Add `2` → `[1, 2]`, sum = `3`.
     - Add `3` → `[1, 2, 3]`, sum = `6`. Valid! Add to the result.
     - Backtrack and try other combinations (e.g., `[1, 2, 4]`), but they exceed the sum.
   - Backtrack completely and start with `2` as the first digit, but no valid combinations remain.
3. Result: `[[1, 2, 3]]`.
